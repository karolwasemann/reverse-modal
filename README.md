## Exercise #15 - Reverse Modal

### How to get started

Click the "Fork" button at the top of the editor to copy the exercise.

### Purpose of exercise

A modal is a window which covers the main application window. We use it when we want additional confirmation of an action the user has initiated, such as deleting an important resource from a database.

Your tasks:

1. implement logic to close the modal when the user clicks on the "X"
2. implement logic to display the modal when the user clicks on the "I accept the challenge" button

Bonus points:

1. close the modal when the user clicks on the grey background and buttons: Surrender/Let's Fly!
